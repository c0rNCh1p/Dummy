	DESCRIPTION
	 Counterstrike 2 (2023) is a tactical multiplayer first person shooter game
	 developed and published by Valve. It is the fifth main installment of the
	 Counterstrike series. Developed as an updated version of the previous main
	 entry, Counterstrike: Global Offensive (2012), it was announced on March 22,
	 2023 and was released on September 27, 2023, replacing CSGO on Steam. Like its
	 predecessor, the game pits two teams, the Counter Terrorists and Terrorists,
	 against each other in various gamemodes, most of which are objective based.
	 Counterstrike 2 features major technical improvements over CSGO, including a
	 move from the Source game engine to Source 2, improved graphics and new server
	 architecture. In addition, many maps from CSGO were updated to utilize the
	 features of Source 2, with some maps receiving complete overhauls.
