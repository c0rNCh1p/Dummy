	DESCRIPTION
	 LibreOffice is a free and open source office productivity suite, a project of
	 The Document Foundation (TDF). It was forked in 2010 from OpenOffice.org, an
	 open sourced version of the earlier StarOffice. Its suite consists of programs
	 for word processing, creating and editing of spreadsheets, slideshows, diagrams
	 and drawings, working with databases, and composing mathematical formulae. Its
	 available in 115 languages. TDF doesnt provide support for LibreOffice, but
	 Enterprised focused editions are available from companies in the ecosystem.
	 LibreOffice uses the OpenDocument standard as its native file format, but
	 supports formats of most other major office suites, including Microsoft Office,
	 through a variety of import and export filters. LibreOffice is available for a
	 variety of computing platforms, with official support for Microsoft Windows,
	 macOS and Linux and community builds for many other platforms. LibreOffice is
	 the default office suite of most popular Linux distributions. It is the most
	 actively developed free and open source office suite, with approximately 50
	 times the development activity of Apache OpenOffice, the other major descendant
	 of OpenOffice.org, in 2015. LibreOffice Online is an online office suite which
	 includes the applications Writer, Calc and Impress and provides an upstream for
	 projects such as commercial Collabora Online. The project was announced and a
	 beta released on 28 September 2010. In the nine months between January 2011
	 (the first stable release) and on October 2011, LibreOffice had been downloaded
	 about 7.5 million times. In 2015, the project claimed 120 million unique 
	 downloading addresses from May 2011 to May 2015, excluding Linux distributions,
	 with 55 million of those being from May 2014 to May 2015. The Document 
	 Foundation estimates that there are 200 million active LibreOffice users
	 worldwide approximately 25% are students and 10% are Linux users.
