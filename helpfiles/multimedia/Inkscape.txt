	DESCRIPTION
	 Inkscape is a Free and open source vector graphics editor. It offers a rich
	 set of features and is widely used for both artistic and technical
	 illustrations such as cartoons, clip art, logos, typography, diagramming
	 and flowcharting. It uses vector graphics to allow for sharp printouts and
	 renderings at unlimited resolution and is not bound to a fixed number of
	 pixels like raster graphics. Inkscape uses the standardized SVG file format
	 as its main format, which is supported by many other applications including
	 web browsers. The interface is designed to be comfortable and efficient for
	 skilled users, while remaining conformant to GNOME standards. SVG is a W3C
	 standard XML format for 2D vector drawing. It allows defining objects in
	 the drawing using points, paths, and primitive shapes. Colors, fonts,
	 stroke width, and so forth are specified as style attributes to these
	 objects. Inkscape uses SVG as its native document format, and has the goal
	 of becoming the most fully compliant drawing program for SVG files
	 available in the Open Source community.
