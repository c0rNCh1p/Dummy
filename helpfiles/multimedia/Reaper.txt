	DESCRIPTION
	 REAPER (Rapid Environment for Audio Production, Engineering, and Recording)
	 is a digital audio workstation and MIDI sequencer software created by
	 Cockos. REAPER acts as a host to most industry standard plugin formats
	 (eg. VST and AU) and can import all commonly used media formats, including
	 video. REAPER and its included plugins are available in 32-bit and 64-bit
	 format. While not a dedicated video editor, REAPER can be used to cut and
	 trim video files and to edit or replace the audio within. Common video
	 effects such as fades, wipes and cross-fades are available. REAPER aligns
	 video files in a project, as it would an audio track, and the video part of
	 a file can be viewed in separate video window while working on the project.

	COMMANDS
