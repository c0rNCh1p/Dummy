	DESCRIPTION
	 Ardour is a hard disk recorder and digital audio workstation that runs on 
	 Linux, Mac, FreeBSD and Windows which is suitable for professional use. Its 
	 primary creator Paul Davis is also responsible for the Jack Audio Connection 
	 Kit. Ardour is free software, released under the terms of the GPL 2.0 or later. 
	 Its audio recording and production ability is limited only by the hardware its 
	 run on. Monitoring options include self monitoring, external hardware support, 
	 and specialised software support. Ardour supports an arbitrary number of tracks 
	 and busses through an anything to anywhere routing system. All parameters can 
	 be automated and sample data is mixed and maintained internally in 32 bit 
	 floating point format. Ardour can read most if not all media file formats and 
	 has high grade export capability. While written in C, Ardour also has built in 
	 compatibility with Lua, which is used to extend its functionality.

	COMMON USAGE
	MIDI SETTINGS
	   # Its helpful to make sure that MIDI notes are sounded as they are selected
	   # in the editor, they will also be sounded as they are created
	 > Edit # Go to the edit menu tab
	  > Preferences # Select the preferences option
	   > MIDI # Go to the MIDI tab
	     > Sound MIDI notes as they are selected in the editor: 'on' # Turn it on
	   # Make sure that copied MIDI regions create a new file rather than modify the 
	   # original file which can cause issues if that file is needed later. There
	   # is also a setting to disable overlapping notes
	 > Session # Go to the session menu tab
	  > Properties # Select the properties option
	   > Misc # Go to the misc tab
	     > MIDI region copies are independent: 'on' # Turn it on
	     > Policy for handling overlapping notes on the same MIDI channel: 'Never
	       allow them' # Set this policy to make sure that theres no overlapping 
	   # notes on the same channel which are difficult to visually identify and can 
	   # cause issues with gain and velocity if not removed
	     > 'Use these settings as defaults' # Select to enable globally
	   # If notes are still overlapping it may be due to making accidental
	   # duplications of notes while in edit mode, while meaning to be in grab mode
