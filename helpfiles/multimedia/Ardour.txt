DESCRIPTION
 Ardour is a hard disk recorder and digital audio workstation that runs on 
 Linux, Mac, FreeBSD and Windows which is suitable for professional use. Its 
 primary creator Paul Davis is also responsible for the Jack Audio Connection 
 Kit. Ardour is free software, released under the terms of the GPL 2.0 or later. 
 Its audio recording and production ability is limited only by the hardware its 
 run on. Monitoring options include self monitoring, external hardware support, 
 and specialised software support. Ardour supports an arbitrary number of tracks 
 and busses through an anything to anywhere routing system. All parameters can 
 be automated and sample data is mixed and maintained internally in 32 bit 
 floating point format. Ardour can read most if not all media file formats and 
 has high grade export capability. While written in C, Ardour also has built in 
 compatibility with Lua, which is used to extend its functionality.s

COMMON USAGE
  # the following settings are for midi usage
 > Edit # go to the edit menu tab
  > Preferences # select preferences
   > MIDI # select the MIDI tab
    > Sound MIDI notes as they are selected in the editor : 'on' # enable the
  # setting to make sure playback of midi notes can be heard externally (upon 
  # selection) and not strictly during playback
 > Session # go to the session menu tab
  > Properties # select properties
   > Misc # select the misc tab
    > MIDI region copies are independent : 'on' # enable the setting to make
  # sure that copied midi regions create a new file rather than modify the 
  # original file which can cause issues if needed later
    > Policy for handling overlapping notes on the same MIDI channel : 'Never
      allow them' # set this policy to make sure that theres no overlapping 
  # notes on the same channel which are difficult to visually identify and can 
  # cause issues with velocity if not deleted
    > 'Use these settings as defaults' # select to enable globally
