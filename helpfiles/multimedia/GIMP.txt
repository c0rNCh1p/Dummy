DESCRIPTION
 GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is used to edit and manipulate images. It
 can load and save a variety of image formats and can be used to convert between
 formats. It can also be used as an illustrator and features a set of drawing and
 painting tools such as airbrush, clone, pencil, and paint brush which can be
 applied to an image with a variety of different modes. GIMP also offers an
 extensive array of selection tools like rectangle, ellipse, fuzzy select,
 bezier select, intelligent scissors, and select by color and many plugins that
 perform a variety of image manipulations. Examples include bumpmap, edge
 detect, gaussian blur, and many others. In addition, GIMP has several scripting
 extensions which allow for advanced non interactive processing and creation of
 images. GIMP ships with a second binary called 'gimp-console' which make GIMP
 behave as if it was called with the '--no-interface' command line option.
