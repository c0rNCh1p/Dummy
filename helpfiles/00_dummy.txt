	DESCRIPTION:
	 This is a dummy help file for a program. Note the styling of this page,
	 the text is indented because highlight is being used to modify the amount
	 space characters in a tab to create a margin. The file is 80 cols by 52 lines 
	 (minimum for bat) not counting the tab chars, a true feat of science. The idea
	 behind formatting these files, is to maintain the readability of the various
	 forms of information pertaining to different software.

	COMMANDS:
	 dummy # run dummy
	 dummy --flag # run dummy with the flag
	 dummy -f <file> # dummy with the flag on the file

	SHORTCUTS:
