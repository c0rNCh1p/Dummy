	 This is a dummy help file for a program. Note the styling of this page,
	 the text is indented because highlight is being used to modify the amount
	 space characters in a tab to create a margin. The file is 80 cols by 54 lines 
	 (minimum for bat at standard terminal size) not counting the tab chars. This

	 pertaining to different software.
