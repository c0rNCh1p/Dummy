	DESCRIPTION
	 The GNU Bourne Again Shell. Bash is a shell compatible command language
	 interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a
	 file. Bash also incorporates useful features from the Korn and C shells. Bash
	 is intended to be a conforming implementation of the Shell and Utilities
	 portion of the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) POSIX
	 (Portable Operating System Interface) specification (IEEE Standard 1003.1).	 
	 
	COMMANDS
	 bash # Launch or refresh command line shell session
	 bash -i # Launch or refresh interactive shell session
	 bash -l # Launch or refresh login (root) shell session
	 bash -r # Launch or refresh restricted shell session 
	 bash -c # Launch a subshell to run commands in the background
	 bash -x <script.sh> # Enable debugging mode for bash scripts
	 bash +x <script.sh> # Enable reverse debugging mode for bash scripts

	BUILTINS
	   # Bash is pretty big, many of its builtin functions and commands have their
	   # own flags and some also have a binary. Every element in this list can
	   # either be used on the command line or from a script. Each builtin has a
	   # manual page and help output explaining its usage and flag options
	 alias # List or define new aliases
	 bg # Run jobs in the background
	 bind # Bind a name to a socket
	 break # Exit from a loop
	 builtin # Explicitly execute commands as a shell builtins
	 caller # Return the context of the current subroutine call
	 case # Define a case statement
	 cd # Change directory
	 command # Execute a simple command
	 compgen # Display possible completions depending on the options
	 complete # Specify how arguments are to be completed by readline
	 compopt # Modify or display completion options

	 coproc # Run a command in a subshell asynchronously
	 declare # Set variable values and attributes
	 dirs # Display directory stack
