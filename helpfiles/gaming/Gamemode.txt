GAMEMODE

DESCRIPTION
GameMode is a daemon library combo for Linux created by FeralInteractive that
allows games to request a set of optimisations to be temporarily applied to a 
game process. GameMode was designed primarily as a stop-gap solution to problems
with the Intel and AMD CPU powersave or ondemand governors, but is now host to a
range of optimisation features and configurations. Currently GameMode includes
support for optimisations including CPU govening, I/O prioritization, setting
Process niceness, Kernel scheduling (SCHED_ISO), Screensaver inhibiting,
switching to GPU performance mode (NVIDIA and AMD), GPU overclocking (NVIDIA),
CPU core pinning or parking and Custom scripting. GameMode packages are
available for Ubuntu, Debian, Solus, Arch, Gentoo, Fedora, OpenSUSE, Mageia and
possibly more.
