	DESCRIPTION
	 Proton is a compatibility layer for Windows games to run on Linux-based
	 operating systems. Proton is developed by Valve in cooperation with developers
	 from CodeWeavers. It is a collection of software and libraries combined with a
	 patched version of Wine to improve performance and compatibility with Windows
	 games. Proton is designed for integration into the Steam client as
	 Steam Play. It is officially distributed through the client, although
	 third-party forks can be manually installed. Proton was initially released on
	 21 August 2018. Upon release, Valve announced a list of 27 games that were
	 tested and certified to perform like their native Windows counterparts without
	 requiring end-user tweaking. These include Doom (2016), Quake, and Final
	 Fantasy VI. Proton incorporates several libraries that improve 3D performance.
	 These include Direct3D-to-Vulkan translation layers, namely DXVK for Direct3D
	 9, 10 and 11, and VKD3D-Proton for Direct3D 12. A separate library known as
	 D9VK handled Direct3D 9 support until it was merged into DXVK in December 2019.
	 Proton-GE-custom is a custom build of proton which creator Glorious Eggroll
	 made available and updates regularly. Some argue that the GE-custom build is
	 better than the vanilla build of proton, especially on lower end hardware and
	 linux systems in general.

	COMMON USAGE
	INSTALLING AND ENABLING
	   # Proton-GE can be either installed directly from the AUR with an AUR helper
	   # for Arch users, otherwise it can be built from source following the
	   # instructions on Glorious Eggrolls github
	 yay proton-ge-custom # Its a lengthy install
	   # To enable Proton-GE in Steam, open steam (native)
	 > Steam Menu # Open the steam menu
	   > Compatability # Navigate to the compatability section
	     > Enable Steam Play for all other titles: <on> # Check the box to enable
	   # for all titles, to use the custom build of proton with a game, go to the
	   # games library within Steam and open the context menu for the game
	 > Properties # Select the properties option
	   > Compatability # Navigate to the compatability section
	     > Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatability tool: <on> # Check
	   # the box to force the use of Proton, and make sure that Proton-GE is
	   # selected in the dropdown box in both the Steam menu and the game properties
	STEAM NATIVE RUNTIME
	   # There is a package in the Arch repos called steam-native-runtime which is
	   # an unlisted dependancy of proton-GE-custom, this is a runtime version of
	   # Steam native and the binary can be ignored, but it will be included and
	   # used with proton-GE-custom if its installed with an AUR helper like yay
