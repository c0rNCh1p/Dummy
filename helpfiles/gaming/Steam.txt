	DESCRIPTION
	 Steam is a video game digital distribution service and storefront by Valve. It
	 was launched as a software client in September 2003 as a way for Valve to
	 provide automatic updates for their games, and expanded to distributing and
	 offering third-party game publishers titles in late 2005. Steam offers various
	 features, like digital rights management (DRM), game server matchmaking,
	 anti-cheat measures, social networking and game streaming services. It provides
	 the user with automatic game updating, saved game cloud synchronization, and
	 community features such as friends messaging, in-game chat and a community
	 market. Valve released a freely available application programming interface
	 (API) called Steamworks in 2008, which developers can use to integrate Steams
	 functions into their products, including in-game achievements, user
	 created-content support, and microtransactions. Initially developed for
	 Microsoft Windows operating systems, Steam was released for macOS in 2010 and
	 Linux in 2012. Mobile apps to access online Steam features were first released
	 for iOS and Android in 2012. The platform also offers other digital content and
	 Valve gaming hardware, including productivity software, game soundtracks,
	 videos and VR headset Valve Index. The service is the largest digital
	 distribution platform for PC gaming, estimated around 75% of the market share
	 in 2013 according to IHS Screen Digest. By 2017, users purchasing games through
	 Steam totaled approximately US$4.3 billion, representing at least 18% of global
	 PC game sales according to Steam Spy. By 2021, the service had over 34,000
	 games with over 132 million monthly active users. The success of Steam has led
	 to the development of the Steam Machine line of gaming PCs in 2015, which
	 includes the SteamOS operating system and Steam Controller, Steam Link devices
	 for local game streaming, and the handheld Steam Deck.

	COMMON USAGE
	MANAGING GAMEFILES
	 '/home/$USER/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/' # Directory where all games and
	   # software installed or run through steam is kept which can be copied to an
	   # external hard drive, smaller games can fit onto a USB
	 '/run/media/$USER/drive/games/' # Games can be installed directly onto a
	   # hard drive through the steam interface in order to save storage, in order
	   # restore a game from its actual location to the system and add it to the
	   # steam library, the steam interface is also used
	 > Steam Menu # Open the steam menu
	   > Restore Game backup # Select the restore game backup option and provide the
	   # path to the gamefiles, sometimes games may present issues and there is a
	   # liklihood that the cause of the issue is related to the gamefiles on the
	   # system, in order to run a check on the gamefiles to verify their integrity,
	   # go to the games library within Steam and open the context menu for the game
	 > Properties # Select the properties option
	   > Installed Files # Navigate to the installed files section
	     > Verify Integrity of game files # Run the integrity check on the game, if
	   # isues still persist or are happening for multiple games an attempt can be
	   # made to repair the files in the library, its best to do an integrity
	   # check on problematic games before using this feature in Steam
	 > Steam Menu # Open the Steam Menu
	   > Storage # Navigate to the storage section
	     > ... # Select the three dotted line next to the storage info
	       > Repair Library # Run the repair process, this overall approach to
	   # storage management and solving issues with games in Steam is much more
	   # effective than constantly uninstalling and reinstalling games taking up
	   # time and bandwidth

	STEAM PLAY
	   # Steam Play is the feature that allows users to run compatibility layers in
	   # Linux versions of the Steam client. Proton being one of them, which is
	   # based upon another little program called Wine
	NATIVE AND RUNTIME
	   # These binaries configure Steam to globally use Native distro versions of
	   # steam libraries, or Steam Runtime versions provided by Valve as part of
	   # Steam. This is somewhat related to the forced method of running a
	   # compatibility layer. Software that was made for Windows needs to be patched
	   # and reconfigured to work on Linux or Mac. Steam offers a lot of support for
	   # this, the Native builds are part of that support to further improve Steam
	   # functionality on Linux, so its a good idea to use that
